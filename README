The script in this repository can be used to create a RHEL5 chroot.

We plan on using this to provide a RHEL5-compatibility environment for
batch system jobs which require RHEL5, but the local site provides a RHEL6
host environment

To create the chroot, simply run:

./rhel5-in-rhel6-chroot.sh

You must customize the script for your site before using; at the least, you'll
want to customize where the chroot is written.

You may also want to play around with different yum repos, mount different NFS
servers, and play with the base install.

To test this out in a shell, you can run:

chroot /chroot/sl5 bash
