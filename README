This repository provides "chroot-tool", a simple tool designed for quick
and easy chroots.

We plan on using this to provide a RHEL5-compatibility environment for
batch system jobs which require RHEL5, but the local site provides a RHEL6
host environment.

The tool provides basic functionality using "yum", but a complete chroot will
need additional supplements (such as bind mounts).  We include example puppet
manifests for both Condor and PBS sites.

USE:

To create an empty chroot with no installed files:

     chroot-tool create 

To install the base RPMs for RHEL5:

     chroot-tool install acl attr authconfig bc bind-utils bzip2 \
                         cyrus-sasl-plain lsof libcgroup quota rhel-instnum \
                         cpuspeed dos2unix m2crypto sssd nc prctl redhat-lsb \
                         setarch time tree unix2dos unzip wget which zip zlib

That list is customized for our site; adjust for yours.

To remove all world-writable directories and setuid binaries from the chroot,
use the "secure" subcommand:

     chroot-tool secure

To test out the resulting chroot, do the following:

chroot /chroot/sl5 bash

BUILDING:

chroot-tool is a self-contained python script.  However, to build it into an
RPM, do the following:

     ./build_rpm

CONFIGURAITON:

There are basically two configuration decisions you must make.

First, decide where to build the chroot in the filesystem; this is kept in
/etc/chroot-tool/tool.cfg; the default is:

root_dir = /chroot/sl5-v1

Second, you will need to decide what yum repositories to enable for the chroot
(these are necessarily different from the system ones!).  You can configure
yum by editing the file /etc/chroot-tool/yum.conf
